Thanos generic ending:  Davis stares into Thanos' cold grey eyes. His legs begin to tremble and his shiny bald scalp
begins dripping with sweat.  He gives you one last glare before turning around and stomping back to his room.

Space Stone ending: Davis and Dorsch switch places, Davis is very confused.

Reality stone ending:  Thanos turns into a giant duck, Davis is freaks out and runs away

Mind Stone ending: Davis becomes your puppet, now you have to teach computer science. Sorry....

Time Stone ending: Davis goes so far back in time that his hair grows back into a hideous mullet. Davis is horrified and goes to get a haircut

Power Stone ending: The entire math department materializes above Davis and lands on top of him in a dog pile.

Soul Stone ending: Davis gets his soul back, he no longer feels that he needs to display his depression by chasing students

All six stones:  Well, don't act like you didn't see this coming. Half the universe just evaporates along with the 
Might American Buffalo.  Megan and Caleb should never have given Davis that Thanos...



Intro:  It's a chilly December morning, and you just pulled a not quite legal all-nighter in the low-reed locker.  
You slowly regain consciousness to the sounds of something heavy hitting the floor at roughly 75 beats per minute.  You shift uncomfortably
amongst what seems to be a bed of textbooks, review papers, and some stolen soda (which explains the taste of Sundrop in your mouth).
As you make a slight peek out of the locker, you catch a glimpse of what appears to be Mr. Davis stomping past you.

He seems angry, but you're not sure why.  It's rather terrifying if you're honest. You scan the physics notes you neglected to study last
night in search of answers.  Almost prophetically, you read Dorsch's joke for the assignment:

"You know what they say,'the only thing to stop a rampaging Davis is Thanos himself.'"

You remember seeing a Thanos in Davis' room once, though who knows where it may be now (it was a wild night last night afterall).  One thing
is clear, the low-reed locker is getting uncomfortable, and who knows what Davis will do if he finds you.  You'll have to find Thanos,
it's surely the ONLY solution to your problem.  Looks like you're searching the school.

You leave, cautiously checking that Davis isn't anywhere close by. You exit the band locker room

Band 900s hallway: The hallways are quiet this...um...Saturday morning?  Your phone died around midnight, and you aren't really that good at remembering, well, anything, without it.
Maybe that's why you have such bad gra-and would you look at that, you go multiple ways in this hallway.  The world's your oyster as you can choose to go to the 

- Theatre room
- Band room
- Foreign language 900s hallway
- PAC lobby

So yeah... make a choice or go back to the locker room if you like

Commons entrance: You feel strange walking into a commons that is so empty.  Your steps echo as you look across the space, doing nothing to ease your anxieties about Davis.  
"You shouldn't spend much time here," you think to yourself in second person for some odd reason.  You're right, for once. There is no place to hide here and lots of rooms
to check, so best be on your way and out of this desolate space.


- Scan Tables
- Go to hall of fame
- Go to kitchen
- Go to Gallery hallway

Scan Tables (no Thanos): No Thanos here, but you did find a couple of mayonaise packets. But whatever could you want to do with those? 

Found Thanos: The heavens open and glorious trumpets sound inside your head. Thanos, your ticket out of here!! He's still got his hat on, and his glare makes you uncomfortable, but you've done it! Your quest finished and your days of fearing Davis have come to an end.

Now, you've heard stories that infinity stones have also been scattered across South.  It may be a bit riskier, and you think Thanos will probably be enough to stop Davis, but you never know.  Strange things like hidden endings might arise from collecting infinity stones, but the choice is yours on what to do next.

Spanish Classroom entrance: Las paredes de este extraño lugar están cubiertas de carteles de Looney Tunes, mientras que las Piñatas cuelgan del techo.
Una catapulta adorna el rincón de la sala y sientes que las paredes casi te gritan el lenguaje de la clase.
    - escritorio del profesor de la búsqueda
    - escanear las tablas
    - salir


French Classroom entrance: Il y a une kitchenette dans le coin qu'en face de toi, mais tu a un mauvais pressentiment. Il y a une roue colorée en le
le tableau blanc, et tu veux le tourner. Autour de la pièce, il y a les affiches lumineuses, mais tu ne les comprends pas. La pièce est très lumineuses, trop lumineuses.
Tes yeux commencent à faire mal, mais tu dois probablement enquêter en primer.

-regarde les tables
-fouille le bureau de la prof
-tourne la roue
-par

tourne la roue: Tu tournes la roue! Elle s'arrête sur... [random choice of 6 different things, could be infinity stones. note that they won't be gotten here. 
maybe give a location clue?]

fouille le bureau: Tu ne vois rien d'interessent... mais tu pris un crayon du tiroir.

regarde les tables: Ce sont des tables. Attendis-tu?


German Classroom (Room 915) entrance: Der Geruch von brutzelnde Bratwürste verschlingt die Sinne wie Sie seltsame 
Klassenzimmer betreten. Brezeln baumeln von der Decke und einen... Igel? Adler? steht die Uhr auf einem Bücherregal quer durch den Raum.
Das Klassenzimmer fühlt sich warm und gemütlich, trotz des massiven Fensters deutlich draußen im Schnee.

Room 309 (Schmelzle): You aren't sure this room has ever been used.  It must have once been a computer room judging by the tables.  
Yet, for some reason you hear the quiet melodies of spotify's focus track.  To be honest, you've never even
seen this teacher before, you just hear the friends you have in this class never have to do anything.  Ah, a class you could excell at (finally)

- Scan the tables
- Search the teacher's desk
- Leave

Room ___ (Bertrand):  [connect it to the senate vault, maybe, like megan's game is]


501 (FFA Classroom): You're surprised not only by the tile floor at your feet, but the absolute clutter of this room.  You knew ag people were weird but good lord,
there's a lot of crap.  Grow lamps, cabinets, animal diagrams, and a frikin back side of a heifer adorn the walls! Yeah, these guys are really weird. 
The twinkle lights give it a nice, comfortable vibe at least.  You've heard there is a secret passage somewhere in the room, but that might not end up being worth it. 

What's your next course of action?
- Look for the secret passage 
- Scan desk
- Search teacher's desk
    + Add 1 pencil to pencil count ("you gain one pencil")
- Steal a rabbit
    + Add live rabbit to inventory
- Inseminate Betty-Lou the MooHoo
- Leave

Inseminate Betty-Lou: Why, just why? Look let's just act like you didn't waste 3 turns inseminating a fake cow and just move on. Lord, you're weird 



1015 (Mrs. Bubalo's Classroom):  Woah, so this is Senate Headquarters.  You've never had a class in here, though you never much liked psychology, did you?  It's warm and inviting
and yet you feel there is a sense of effeciency to the room as well.  You notice the posters on the wall looking at big world problems like the Darfur genocide, suddenly you aren't
so sure about the whole "senate corruption" scandal.  Someone kind works here, and you aren't sure they would allow that kind of behavior.  

OK, enough introspection, go do something already!
- Scan desks
- Search teacher's desk
- Leave

Search Bubalo's desk: While rummaging through her desk, you notice a strange button underneath her desk, black and without a label.  You've also found the
key to the Senate closet and stolen Mrs. Bubalo's pencil, but this button takes the cake.  It seems so out of place and almost ominous amongst the rest of 
the otherwise totally normal papers and textbooks.

Do you push the button?
- Yes
    You push the button: The button isn't nearly as stiff as it appears, and is pressed easily.  Suddenly, you are startled by the closet against the wall
    sliding down into the floor. A passage way opens up, but there doesn't seem to be power down it.  You peer down the newly revealed steps into the pitch black darkness.
    That's it, Senate is SO CORRUPT!!! You totally need to investigate this, although you still have Davis to worry about. The choice is yours...
    
    Do you enter the passage>
    - Yes
        Trigger Senate Vault descriptions
    - No 
         Oh well, probably for the best you leave it be.  You already have Davis to worry about, no need to add to your list of worries.
    What is your next course of action?

- No
    You don't push it: Oh well, probably for the best you leave it be.  You already have Davis to worry about, no need to add to your list of worries.
    What is your next course of action?

Senate Closet: As the door clicks open, you are surpised by both the size and clutter of this tiny space. It seems every senate member paints their name onto this wall 
at some point.  It's kinda weird, but whatever am I right? There's nothing in here that leads you to consider investigating, and you feel your time would be better spent elsewhere

What do you do next?
- Leave
- Contemplate existence
    - If this is clicked: You ponder what the meaning of all of this is. Of Davis, of yourself, of Thanos...Is there really a meaning behind it all? Why are you running? Why is he chasing you? Why does anyone do anything at all?
        - Give a nihlist answers
            There is no meaning to it...TO ANYTHING! Stunned and shocked by this revalation, you curl up into a ball on the floor and wait for Davis (or death, whichever first) *GAME ENDS*
        - Give an existencial answers
            There must be a meaning, there must.  Maybe finding Thanos will answer this...maybe *you leave*
        - Leave


Senate Vault: You stumble down the stairs, bumping against the wall to try and steady yourself.  The wall feels different, 
not as smooth as normal.  

The stairs keep going down and down, deeper and deeper into the darkness.  You can't see your hands in front of you, all 
you know is you are far below South
by now.  "What is Senate doing down here?", you wonder out loud.  Suddenly you here the sound of the entrance sealing 
itself back up. Ok, time to start freaking out

Your nervousness causes you to trip and start tumbling down the stairs.  You hit a flat bottom quite bruised and in a 
lot of pain.  You feel around until you find a wall
and use it to slowly lift yourself back up to your feet.  As your hand slowly crawls up the wall, you feel the outline 
of a wall switch and you flick it.

Suddenly, hidden bulbs light up in a hazy glow.  You're standing at the bottom of stone stairs, the walls made of smooth 
stones as well.  A set of golden doors faces you, taunting your poor broken soul.  With nowhere else to go, you open it.

Oh my god Senate is corrupt! You push open the door only to be blinded by bright light reflecting off of mounds and 
mounds of gold marble.  Great pillars hold up what must be a vault, and great jewels and piles of coins lay in huge piles across the floor.  Large couches adorn 
the center of the chamber, plush and violet, and a grand marble table stretches to connect them.  A life-sized statue of an jaguar made totally of gold gazes at 
you from your left, sitting on you guessed it, marble podium.  Strange trinkets like you've never seen before adorn the table, relics of lost civilizations, forgotten art from ages past.... and a top. \n You spin it, because why not?

Suddenly, your gaze shifts right, and there it is, the power stone sitting atop a marble podium!  It's all worth it 
now, the bruises and terror.  You've found the power stone! Who knows what this will do to Davis.  You snatch it before thinking about what to do next. 
Well that was a mistake, the moment the power stone is lifted off of its pedistal the roof begins cracking.  The room shakes and you are tossed about while the magnificent pillars tumble to the floor.
Suddenly a boulder rolls into view, headed straight for you! (It seems familiar, but you're not sure from where)  You see an...elavator? Ok, you might be able to make it, but you're gonna need to roll a saving dex throw
    +Random number 1-20
        If number < 15 You die
            - Death: You're crushed beneath the boulder. Who knew Senate would kill to keep its corruption hidden? Oh well, it looks like the secret will die with you.  As the life is squeezed out of your poor body, the last thing you
            see is that still spinning top. /n Wait, has it wobbled at all since it started spinning?
        If number >= 15 You live
            - Escape: You slide into the elavator just in time and the doors shut just before the boulder slams against them. Youch, that would have hurt.  The elavator is quite clean and well lit, still white in its paint and design.
            It opens in the senate clost and you step out. (Enter Senate Closet)

Room 609 (Gran)- So this is what a shop class looks like.  Lots of tables and machines all over the place.  Is that a plasma cutter? Ah, so cool.
Why don't you just use one of those on Davis? Right, federal court. Let's not do that again.....Right, the smell is weird here. Probably molten metal
or something.  And it's all dirty and there's sheet metal all over the place.  Deal with it

What do you do next?
- Inspect tables
- Inspect teacher's desk
- Make an infinity guantlet 
    + Well, atleast you got the middle finger made. You don't know what you're doing, 
    and the metal just gets a bunch of chops in it. It kinda looks like a d- 
    (Put inappropriate metal sculpture in inventory)
- Leave


Room 410 (Messic)- Upon entering the room, you immediatley feel a combination of magic and suffering.  Computers line the walls of this square room while shelves full of 
broken vex pieces. Doors to the wood shop and a mysterious closet catch your eye as you gaze around the sorry wasteland that is the nightmarish room.  You've heard horror stories 
about this place from your friends. Ok, not horror, just a lot of complaints and something about a bathroom.  Still, you're horrified to be in this place and shouldn't spend long here.

What's your next course of action?
- Inspect tables
- Inspect Messic's desk
    + You're too scared to look hard, you just grab a magic Messic pen and move on
- Rob TSA store
    + You gain Messic's Magic Trophy and $5.00
- Inspect the closet
    + Light floods the closet as you step into Narnia. You're in the middle of the woods and wind lightly ripples across the grass and trees.  You feel safe all of the sudden, like Davis can't get you here, as if you're in a whole new world, safe from the whims of Thanos or Davis.  
- Go to woodshop
- Leave

Narnia:






Hey, can you write what happens after davis catches you?

Davis catches you:
